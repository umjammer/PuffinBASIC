# PuffinBASIC
A cross-platform modern BASIC compiler/interpreter written in Java.

BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a general-purpose high-level
language from the 1960s. PuffinBASIC is an implementation of the BASIC language specification.
PuffinBASIC conforms most closely to GWBASIC.

## Why Implement BASIC?

1. Love and Familiarity: GWBASIC was my first programming language, I loved it and made many games in it.
1. Interpreter language: BASIC is simple and an interpreted language and hence a good choice for implementing this interpreter.
1. Learn antlr4: I was learning antlr4 and BASIC was the perfect language to try because 
of its simple instruction set.
1. Resurrect BASIC: Implementations such as GWBASIC don't work on most modern platforms. 
My goal is to make PuffinBASIC work anywhere Java can work.
1. Improve BASIC: I wanted to add modern graphics, better data types, etc., to make it easier to write games.

## Version

0.1 experimental (NOT YET READY FOR PRODUCTION USE!)

- The interpreter is not yet thoroughly tested and is likely to have bugs.
- This is an active project so expect large changes at frequent intervals.

## Dependencies
JDK 11+, Maven, antlr4

## Build and test

```
$ mvn compile
$ mvn test
```

## Run using Maven
```
$ mvn exec:java -D"exec.args"="samples/graph.bas"
```

Graphics mode:
```
$ mvn exec:java -D"exec.args"="-g samples/graphics.bas"
```

## Working with Intellij

Import the pom.xml file in Intellij.
After importing, if you make a change to the antlr4 grammar,
regenerate the antlr4 code using following command and then reload the changes.
```
$ mvn generate-sources
```

## How it works?

1. PuffinBASIC's grammar is defined using antlr4.
1. The user source code is parsed using antlr4 lexer+parser.
1. An intermediate representation (IR) is generated. 
A symbol table keeps track of variables, scalars, arrays, etc. objects.
1. The interpreter runtime processes the IR instructions and executes them in a single thread.
For graphics, an optional Runtime is used.

Since PuffinBASIC generates IR from source code and the runtime executes the IR, we can say PuffinBASIC is both a compiler and an interpreter.

## Planned Improvements

1. Android port, requires a rewrite of Graphics runtime.
1. ...

## Performance

PuffinBASIC is an interpreter, and it should not be expected to have very good performance characteristics.
Certain operations such as PRINT USING, INPUT, etc are not optimized for performance.
PuffinBASIC primitives have not been benchmarked.
That being said, games containing 2D graphics work reasonably well.

## Memory

PuffinBASIC runs within a JVM and can use as much memory as available for the JVM process.

# Reference

## Mode of operation

### Indirect Mode

1. Write a program in your favorite editor.
1. Save it in a text file with a '.bas' extension (not a requirement).
1. Use maven or PuffinBasicInterpreterMain to run the program.

PuffinBASIC supports indirect mode only.

### Line-number and No-line-number modes

PuffinBASIC programs can have one of two modes:
1. Line-number mode: All lines must start with a line number. GOTO/GOSUB statements can use both line number and label.
1. No-line-number mode: No line should start with a line number. GOTO/GOSUB statements can use label only.

## Compatibility

PuffinBASIC is mostly compatible with Microsoft's GWBASIC.
Graphics is supported using Java 2D graphics.

PuffinBASIC will not support assembly instructions.

### Input

PuffinBASIC aims for cross-platform compatibility and doesn't support platform specific features. 
Input statements and functions are line based and require 'ENTER' key to be pressed.
Same applies for the sequential file writes, print statements always output a line and input statements read the whole line.

### Case sensitivity

Operators, Statements and Standard Functions are case-insensitive.
Constants, variables and user defined functions are case-sensitive.

### Graphics

Graphics uses platform-independent Swing window.
Graphics functions are slightly different and more general than GWBASIC.
Graphics statements/functions require a '-g' flag to be set at runtime.
See Graphics section in reference.
PRINT/WRITE statements are displayed on standard out only.
For displaying text on Swing window, new statements are added.

### DIM

DIM statement declares size of each dimension (rather than maximum value of the dimension).

### Data Types

PuffinBASIC supports scalar, array, struct, list, set and dict types.
Int32, Int4, Float32, Float64, and String are the scalar types.
Each scalar type has a corresponding array type.

## Commands

PuffinBASIC does not support BASIC Commands, such as LIST, RUN, etc.

## Errors

PuffinBASIC can raise following kind of errors:
1. PuffinBasicSyntaxError: if source code has lexical or parsing error, e.g. missing parenthesis.
1. PuffinBasicSemanticError: if source code has a semantic error, e.g. data type mismatch. 
1. PuffinBasicRuntimeError: if a runtime error happens, e.g. division by zero, IO error, etc.
1. PuffinBasicInternalError: if there is a problem with PuffinBASIC implementation.

## Data Types

### Scalar Types

1. Int32 (32-bit signed integer): Int32 constants can have an optional '%' suffix.
Int32 constants can be decimal, octal or hexadecimal.
Octal numbers must have '&' or '&O' prefix, e.g. &12 or &O12.
Hexadecimal numbers must have '&H' prefix, e.g. &HFF.

1. Int64 (64-bit signed integer): Int64 constants must have '@' suffix.
Int64 constants can be decimal, octal or hexadecimal.

1. Float32 (32-bit signed IEEE-754 floating-point): Float32 constants can have an optional '!' suffix.
Float32 constants can use a decimal format or scientific notations, e.g. 1.2 or 1.2E-2.

1. Float64 (64-bit signed IEEE-754 floating-point): Float64 constants can have an optional '#' suffix.
Float32 constants can use a decimal format or scientific notations, e.g. 1.2 or 1.2E-2.

1. String: String stores any non-newline (or carriage return) ASCII character. 
A string must be enclosed within double-quotes, e.g. "A TEST, STRING".
There is no limit on the length of a string.

### Array Types

1. N-dimensional Int32 Array
1. N-dimensional Int64 Array
1. N-dimensional Float32 Array
1. N-dimensional Float64 Array
1. N-dimensional String Array

### Composite Types

1. Struct: User defined type composed of scalar, array, struct, list, set and dict types.
1. List: Variable length list of scalar and struct values.
1. Set: Unordered open hash-set of scalar values.
1. Dict: Unordered open hash-map of scalar to scalar and struct values.

### Type conversion

Numeric types are converted into one another via implicit type conversion.
String and numeric types are not implicitly converted. 
Use STR$ or VAL functions for conversion between String and numeric values.

## Variables

A variable name must start with a letter followed by one or more letters or numeric digits.
A variable name must not start with 'FN' because it is reserved for user defined functions.

A variable name has an optional suffix which sets the data type.
Int32 variable has '%' suffix, int64 variable has '@' suffix, float32 has '!' suffix,
float64 has '#' suffix, and String has '$' suffix. 
If a suffix is omitted, default data type assumed, the global default is Float64. 

There are three kinds of variables:
1. Scalar variable stores a single value, e.g. A%
1. Array variable stores a multi-dimensional array. An array variable must defined using DIM statement.
An array can have any number of dimensions. The minimum array index is 0 and maximum is dimension length - 1.
1. Composite variable such as struct, list, set and dict.

Example:
```
10 DIM A%(3, 4)
20 A%(1, 2) = 5
```

### Variable Reference

A variable can reference to another variable,
A reference variable does not have a type-suffix.

Syntax:

```
AUTO refVariable = variable
```

Example:

```
A% = 10
AUTO B = A%
B = 3 ' Both A% and B have value 3.

DIM X%(2,3)
AUTO Y = X%
Y(0,0) = 3 ' Both X%(0,0) and Y(0,0) have value 3.
```

## Operators

Order of operations (lower number means higher precedence):

1. Arithmetic
1. Relational
1. Logical or bit-wise

For same precedence, the order is left to right.

Arithmetic (lower number means higher precedence):
1. '^'    Exponentiation
1. '-'    Unary minus
1. '*' or '/' or '\\' Multiplication or Floating point division or Integer division
1. 'mod'  Modulus
1. '+' or '-' Addition or Subtraction

Relational operators return -1 for true and 0 for false.
Relational operators work with both numbers and Strings.

Relational (all have same precedence):
* '='    Equals
* '<>'   Not equals
* '<'    Less than
* '>'    Greate than
* '<='   Less than or equal
* '>='   Greater than or equal

If inputs to logical operators is -1 and 0, they return -1 for true and 0 for false.
Otherwise, logical operators work like bit-wise operators.
'>>' and '<<' are bitwise right-shift and left-shift operators.

Logical or bit-wise (lower number means higher precedence):
1. 'NOT'
1. 'AND' or 'OR' or 'XOR' or 'EQV' or 'IMP'
1. '>>' or <<'

Each line starts with an optional integer line number.
The line number is followed by one or more statements and ends with an optional comment.
Multiple statements in a line can be separated by colon (':').

```
10 LET A = 1 : PRINT A REM COMMENT
20 REM COMMENT
``` 

### Comments

A comment starts with REM or single quote ("'").

Syntax:
```
REM USER TEXT
' COMMENT TEXT
```

### Libraries

PuffinBASIC supports reusing source code via libraries.

A library must set a unique library tag set using LIBTAG.
Libraries cannot have line numbers.

The search path for library can be set in PUFFIN_BASIC_PATH environment variable.
The main source file's path is the default search path.

Use IMPORT statement to import libraries.

Syntax:

```
LIBFILE:
LIBTAG "UNIQUE LIBTAG"
...
...

main.bas:
IMPORT "LIBFILE"
```

Examples:

```
a.bas:
LIBTAG "_a.bas_"
PRINT "Currently in a.bas"

b.bas:
LIBTAG "_b.bas_"
IMPORT "a.bas"
PRINT "Currently in b.bas"

main.bas:
IMPORT "b.bas"
IMPORT "a.bas"
PRINT "Currently in MAIN"
```

### Variables

#### Assignment

Scalar variables are declared and assigned value using LET statement.
The LET keyword is optional.

Syntax:

```
LET variable = expr
variable = expr
```

Example:

```
LET A% = 1
B$ = "ABC"
```

#### Reference Assignment

AUTO can be used to reference the result of an expression
without specifying the type of the reference variable or
allocating the variable.

Syntax:

```
AUTO refint = expr
```

Example:

```
AUTO keys = dict1.keys()
```

#### Arrays

Use DIM keyword to declare an array variable.
dim1, dim2, ... are dimension size (and not max dim value.)
Arrays are stored in row-major order.
The minimum index in an array dimension is 0 and maximum is dim size - 1.
When declaring variables (except within a struct and a UDF param),
an expression can be used to set the dimension size.

Syntax:

```
DIM variable(dim1, dim2, ...)
```

Example:

```
DIM A%(3, 5)
```

The above statements declares a 3x5 Int32 variable.

#### Dynamic Arrays

ALLOCARRAY function Dynamically allocates array.
The result should be assigned to a variable reference.

Syntax:

```
AUTO arrayvarref = ALLOCARRAY varsuffix(dim1, dim2, ...)
```

Example: 
```
AUTO aa1 = ALLOCARRAY%(2, 3)
```

#### Struct

User defined type composed of scalar, array, struct, list, set and dict types.
The array dimensions must be declared using constants in a struct.

### Default Variable Data Type

The following keywords can be used to declare default data type of a variable,
(used when a variable does not have a suffix).

Syntax:

```
DEFINT letter-letter[, letter-letter]
DEFLNG letter-letter[, letter-letter]
DEFSNG letter-letter[, letter-letter]
DEFDBL letter-letter[, letter-letter]
```

Example:

```
DEFINT A-C
```

The above example declares variables starting with A, B and C as Int32.

### Control Statements

#### IF-THEN-ELSE

In case of nested IF-THEN-ELSE, ELSE matches the closest IF statement.

Syntax:

```
IF expression THEN statements ELSE statements
```

Example:

```
IF A > 1 THEN PRINT "A > 1" ELSE PRINT "A <= 1"
```

#### IF-GOTO-ELSE

Syntax:

```
IF expression GOTO linenumber ELSE statements
```

Example:

```
20 IF A > 1 GOTO 100 ELSE 200
```

#### IF-THEN-BEGIN-ELSE-BEGIN-END_IF

PuffinBASIC supports then/else blocks with IF statement.

Syntax:

```
IF expr THEN BEGIN
  stmt1
  stmt2
  ...
ELSE BEGIN
  stmtk
  stmtk+1
  ...
END IF
```

Example:

```
IF A% < 20 THEN BEGIN
  PRINT A%, "LT 20"
ELSE BEGIN
  PRINT A%, "GE 20"
END IF
```

#### LABEL

Create a label.
GOSUB/GOTO can be used with the label name.

Syntax:

```
LABEL "labelname"
```

Example:

```
LABEL "DRAW A LINE"
```

#### GOTO

Jump to the given line number.
In no-linenumber mode, GOTO can be used with label.

Syntax:

```
20 GOTO 100

GOTO "label"
```

#### FOR-NEXT-STEP

For loop.

Syntax:

```
FOR variable = expression TO expression [STEP expression]
...
NEXT [variable]
```

Example:

```
10 FOR I% = 1 TO 10 STEP 2
20 PRINT I%
30 NEXT I%
```

#### WHILE-WEND

While loop.

Syntax:

```
WHILE expression
...
WEND
```

Example:

```
20 WHILE A < 10
30 A = A + 1
40 PRINT A
50 WEND
```

#### END

Marks the end of the program.

#### GOSUB-RETURN

Goto the subroutine. After subroutine finishes (on RETURN statement), 
the program execution returns to the statement after GOSUB.
Subroutines should be defined at the end of the program.
Subroutines share the same scope as the main program.

In no-linenumber mode, GOSUB can be used with label.

Syntax:

```
GOSUB linenum
RETURN

GOSUB "label"
RETURN 
```

Example:

```
...
20 GOSUB 110
...
100 END
110 REM subrouting 1
...
200 RETURN
```

```
...
GOSUB "sub1"
...
END

LABEL "sub1"
...
RETURN
```

### User Defined Function or UDF

A UDF executes an expression.
The UDF returns the result of the expression which is always a scalar.
The UDF can declare local scoped parameters.
UDF can access variables from global scope.
Recursive UDF is not supported.

Syntax:

```
DEF variable(variables) = expr
```

The variable name must start with 'FN' and may have a suffix to declare the return data type.


Example:

```
DEF FNsquare%(X%) = X% * X%
```

The above example computes the square of Int32 parameter X%.

### More general User defined function

A function is a UDF that can take any number of parameters and returns a single scalar value.

The function parameter are passed as follows:
1. Scalar params are passed-by-value.
1. Array/Composite params are passed-by-reference. 
Note that references themselves are copied.
The array dimensions must be declared using constants.

A function has local scope, i.e. it cannot access variables declared outside the function.

Recursive functions are not supported.

Syntax:

```
' Define function
FUNCTION funcname[varsuffix] (PARAMS) {
    ...
    RETURN expression
}

' Call function
result = funcname[varsuffix](VALUES)
```

Example:

```
FUNCTION fun1# (X, Y) {
  IF Y = 0 THEN RETURN 0
  Z = X / Y
  RETURN Z
}

PRINT fun1#(2, 3)
```

### READ-DATA-RESTORE

DATA keyword is used to define constant values.
The READ keyword is used to read the constant values sequentially.
When all the values are read, the read cursor can be reset by using RESTORE statement.

Syntax:

```
DATA constants
...
DATA constants

READ variables
RESTORE
READ variables
```

Example:

```
10 DATA "STRING", 2, 5.2
20 READ A$, B%, C#
30 RESRORE
40 READ A$, B%, C#
```

### Input Output

#### PRINT

Print the expressions to standard out.

Syntax:

```
PRINT expressions
```

The expressions can be either separated by comma or semi-colon.

Example:

```
PRINT "AB", 1, 2
PRINT "AB"; 1; 2
PRINT "AB", 1, 2,
```

If there is no comma at the end of PRINT statement, a new-line is printed.
If there is a comma at the end of PRINT statement, no new-line is printed.

#### PRINT USING

Formats each expression using the given format and prints to standard out.

Syntax:

```
PRINT USING format; expressions
```

The format is a string expression.

##### Formatting String expressions
- '!' Prints the first character of each String expression.
- '&' Prints the entire String for each String expression.
- '\\n spaces\\' Prints n+2 characters from each String expression.

##### Formatting numeric expressions
- '#' specifies 1 digit position.
- '.' specifies decimal point.
- ',' adds comma in formatted number.
      
###### First optional prefix:
- '+' prefix will add a sign prefix.
- '-' prefix will add a minus prefix for negative number.
 
###### Next optional prefix:
- '\*\*' causes leading spaces to be filled with '*' and specifies 2 more digit positions.
- '\*\*$' adds dollar prefix, causes leading spaces to be filled with '*' and specifies 2 more digit positions.
- '$$' add dollar prefix and specifies 1 more difit position.
      
###### First optional suffix:
- '+' suffix will add a sign suffix.
- '-' suffix will add a minus suffix for negative number.
      
###### Next optional suffix:
- '^^^^' suffix indicates scientific notation.

Examples:

```
PRINT USING "\ \"; "123456"; "abcdef"
PRINT using "###.##"; 2.3
PRINT using "**###.##"; 2.3
PRINT using "**$###.##"; 2.3
```

#### WRITE

Prints expressions on standard out.
It separates each expression with a comma.
Strings are surrounded with double quotes.

#### INPUT

Reads user input from standard in and assigns to variables.

Syntax:

```
INPUT [prompt ;] variables
```

Since PuffinBASIC is platform independent, user must press ENTER to mark the end of input.
After reading a line from standard in, INPUT will split the line using commas
into separate values (line a CSV line) and assign to each variable.
If the number of values don't match number of variables, the user will be
asked to enter the values again.

Example:

```
INPUT "Enter two numbers: "; A%, B%
```

#### LINE INPUT

Reads one line from standard in.

Syntax:

```
LINE INPUT [prompt ;] stringVariable
```

Example:

```
LINE INPUT "Enter a line: "; A$
```

### File Handling

#### Random Access Files

Random access file allows reading and writing data in fixed length records.
The default record length is 128.

Syntax:

```
OPEN "R", #filenum, filename[, recordlen]
OPEN filename FOR RANDOM AS #filenum LEN=recordlen
FIELD#filenum, int as variable, int as variable, ...
LSET variable = expr
...
PUT#filenum, recordnum
GET#filenum, recordnum
CLOSE#filenum
```

Example:

```
30 OPEN "R", #1, FILENAME$, 24
40 FIELD#1, 8 AS A$, 8 AS B$, 8 AS C$
50 FOR I% = 1 TO 5
60 LSET A$ = MKI$(I%)
70 LSET B$ = MKI$(I% + 1)
80 LSET C$ = MKI$(I% + 2)
90 PUT #1
100 PRINT LOC(1), LOF(1)
110 NEXT I%
120 FOR I% = 1 TO 5
130 GET #1, I% - 1
140 PRINT A$, B$, C$, LOC(1), LOF(1)
150 NEXT
160 CLOSE
```

#### Sequential Access Files

Syntax:

```
OPEN "O", #filenum, filename
OPEN "A", #filenum, filename
OPEN "I", #filenum, filename

OPEN filename FOR OUTPUT AS #filenum
OPEN filename FOR APPEND AS #filenum
OPEN filename FOR INPUT AS #filenum

WRITE#filenum, expr, expr, ...
PRINT#filenum, expr, expr, ...

CLOSE#filenum
```

When writing a sequential file, prefer using WRITE# over PRINT# statements.

Example: Writing a sequential file

```
20 OPEN "O", #1, FILENAME$
30 FOR I% = 1 TO 5
40 WRITE#1, "ABC" + STR$(I%), 123 + I%, 456@ + I%, 1.2 + I%
50 NEXT
60 FOR I% = 1 TO 5
70 PRINT#1, CHR$(34), "ABC" + STR$(I%), CHR$(34), ",", 123 + I%, ",", 456@ + I%, ",", 1.2 + I%
80 NEXT
90 CLOSE #1
```

Example: Reading a sequential file

```
100 OPEN FILENAME$ FOR INPUT AS #1
110 FOR I% = 1 TO 10
120 INPUT#1, A$, B%, C@, D#
130 PRINT A$, B%, C@, D#
140 NEXT
150 CLOSE
```

### DATE TIME

#### DATE$

Date can be set to a String (for the duration of program only).

Syntax:

```
v$ = DATE$
DATE$ = "YYYY-mm-dd"
```

```

### ARRAY2DSHIFTVER

Shift rows up or down by given n rows in the given 2D array.
The empty space (rows) is filled with 0 or empty string.
n >= 0 means shift rows down.
n < 0 means shift rows up.
This is a very efficient operation.

Syntax:

```
ARRAY2DSHIFTVER arrayvariable, n
```

Example:

```
ARRAY2DSHIFTVER D%, 2
ARRAY2DSHIFTVER D%, -3
```

### ARRAY2DSHIFTHOR

Shift columns up or down by given n columns in the given 2D array.
The empty space (columns) is filled with 0 or empty string.
n >= 0 means shift columns down.
n < 0 means shift columns up.
This operation should be faster than doing it with loops, but not as efficient as ARRAY2DSHIFTVER.

Syntax:

```
ARRAY2DSHIFTHOR arrayvariable, n
```

Example:

```
ARRAY2DSHIFTHOR D%, 2
ARRAY2DSHIFTHOR D%, -3
```

## Graphics

Example:

```
PSET (100, 100)
```

### CIRCLE

```

Example:

```
LINE (0, 0) - (10, 10), "BF"
```

### PAINT

Flood fills the drawing canvas starting at the given position with foreground color
until the given color boundary is hit.
Flood fill has no effect if called on a point which already has foreground color.
PAINT is a slow operation.
Prefer filling the shapes using "F" option.

Syntax:

```
PAINT (x, y), border_r, border_g, border_b
```

Example:

```
PAINT (155, 155), 255, 255, 255
```

### DRAW

N:    return to original position after drawing; 
        can be added to any of above instructions.
Mx,y: move to x,y (absolute or relative). 
        If x and y have +/- prefix, 
        move is relative to curren position,
